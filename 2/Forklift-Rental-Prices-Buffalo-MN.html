If you are a forklift operator, be sure to fasten your seat belt before moving the equipment. They're the most common type of cargo transport truck in stores, but they're also popular in warehouses and distribution centers, too. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>

For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
