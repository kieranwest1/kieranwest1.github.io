If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>
<p>Our versatile Furniture Orderpickers enable you to equip your truck with the ideal fork length with extended baselegs for rail guidance application; select from varying fork lengths ranging from 42-96 inches.
