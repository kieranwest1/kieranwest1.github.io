<p>In terms of their use, apart from being very fast, counterbalanced forklifts are ideal for working both inside and outside the warehouse. The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
<p>Still, gas forklifts are more popular for many outdoors jobs.
