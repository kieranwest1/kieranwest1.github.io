<p>The Southeast team has years of experience managing large forklift companies, owning and operating wholesale forklift companies and turning wrenches when we need to. Consider what you will be using your forklift for and what processes you want to optimise before choosing any new machinery and training employees. Like class 1 forklifts, class 2s are also battery-powered and are more optimally used within a warehouse rather than out in the shipping yard.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>This powered industrial truck contains twin forks extending in the front and is used to carry heavy loads. We have specialized in new and used forklift sales in Surrey, Vancouver and surrounding areas for over 41 years. Suitable for indoor horizontal transportation and stacking, such as in warehouses, distribution centers and logistics companies, the Toyota range of powerful reach trucks offers high acceleration and exceptional drivability for optimum pallet movement.</p>
