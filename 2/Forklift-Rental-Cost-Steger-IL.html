Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction.

<p>There are two main types of side loader forklifts, the enclosed cab that is most commonly used outdoors, and a stand up version that is more suited to indoor tasks. When placed on the forks, the center of the test weight shall be located on the longitudinal centerline of the truck. This online course is meant for forklift operators, site safety engineers and managers in charge of following job site safety regulations.</p>
