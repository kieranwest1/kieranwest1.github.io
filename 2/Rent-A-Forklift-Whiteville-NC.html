<h3>Osha Forklift Safety Whiteville NC</h3>
<p>This hybrid design gives operators the flexibility to program the truck to run on its own or operate manually as a traditional lift truck. Whether you need an order picker for a warehouse or a more rugged machine for moving construction materials on rough terrain, Westminster Lift Truck has the full range of equipment to support your needs. Whether you need to purchase or rent, Northwest Forklift can provide quality new and used forklifts.</p>
<p>We back most used forklifts with a 1 year parts and labour warranty. With excellent machine and load stability due to an optimum centre of gravity and suspension provided by large diameter tyres, these machines provide high mobility and great productivity in rough terrain environments. It is rumored that electric forklifts are maintenance free due to less moving parts and their cleaner environments.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
