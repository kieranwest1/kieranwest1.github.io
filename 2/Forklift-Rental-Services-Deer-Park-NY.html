<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Keep these statistics in mind while training workers and safely operating forklifts.

<p>First forklifts appeared already in the early 20th century, and were used in World War II. Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors. One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking.

This is a unique walkie counterbalance truck which was designed to operate in a large chemical manufacturing facility.

<p>In reality if you go through all the trouble of lifting your truck you will also spend most of you paycheck on other parts to put on it. Large tires, smoke stacks, custom paint jobs, longer towing style mirrors, shiny headlights, and accent lighting are common.

Class VII: Rough terrain forklift trucks - Exclusively for outdoor use, these trucks handle rough terrains such as unimproved construction sites. Pallet trucks are used for unloading and stuffing goods that are delivered on the pallet such as cartons and tinned goods.</p>
<p>Forklift Trucks have a significant and higher share across the food and beverage industry. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. I notice two things right off the bat; one, the truck looks just about at home up there on that lift kit as it does on its stock ride height; and two, it hasn't seemed to have aged.</p>
