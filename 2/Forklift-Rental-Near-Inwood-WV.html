<p>Order pickers do exactly what their name implies - they pick” orders in a warehouse for stores, other distribution centers, retail centers, and more. Once you've decided on the forklift fuel type and lifting capacity, begin your search for unused and used forklifts in our current inventory. You can also hire our trucks for a longer fixed-term rental period, for up to 7 years.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
