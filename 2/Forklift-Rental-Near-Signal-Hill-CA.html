<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet.

<p>Whether you're considering a lifted truck for work, pleasure, or both, there are some important benefits to think about as you get ready to decide what your next vehicle purchase should be. Size for size, diesel forklifts that are intended for outdoor use are generally the most powerful. Weight capacity is an important detail when planning your forklift rental because you do not want to pay for a rental only to find that it cannot safely lift the loads you need to handle.</p>

Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that more than 540,000 forklift operators are employed across the country in all 50 states. Designed to work in narrow aisles, the electric reach stacker can tilt both forwards and backwards for safer load handling.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
