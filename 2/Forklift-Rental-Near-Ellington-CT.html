Their decision to go with a Liftking product was in part due to the versatility of Liftking's robust rough-terrain forklift,‚Äù says Mark Aldrovandi, sales manager at Liftking. The most important things to know when you choose a forklift are its size, lift and load capacity, and configuration.</p>
<p>However, when you purchase a used forklift, operators will already be familiar with the forklift operations and can easily take over the job.

This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>
