If you transport large quantities of goods and heavy loads across short distances on a daily basis, you will soon reap the benefits of using our manual hand pallet trucks.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.
