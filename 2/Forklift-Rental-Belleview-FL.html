<p>I'd also like to say that I drive a truck, 2010 F-150 Platinum everyday to and from work and love trucks very dearly as I grew up driving them in Iowa. This is the most common type of forklift, used in warehouses and shipping centers all over the world. If you have never really thought much about lifted trucks before, then you might wonder why you would ever want a truck lifted up in the first place.</p>
<p>The walk-behind pallet stacker is basically a forklift with a mast, operating on battery power. Many forklifts have an automatic alarm that will sound when you travel in reverse. Our Forklift Service department and Forklift Parts department is proud to offer service and parts for all major forklift brands. The larger tires allowed by lifted trucks is one of the biggest advantages for going off-road with this type of vehicle.</p>

Moreover, the Motorised pallet truck we offer is quality approved and sturdy. They excel at having the best matched rental equipment for your application.
