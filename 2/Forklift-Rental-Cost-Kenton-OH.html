Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction.

This product range is capable of moving the heavy loads very easily and for the packing goods in warehouses, stores and factories.</p>
