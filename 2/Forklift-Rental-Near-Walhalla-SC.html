Not move the truck and remain at the controls at all times, if operating an industrial lift truck with a forklift platform with an employee on the platform. For trucks with tilting forks, the forks shall be horizontal or at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable.

<p>Therefore owing to the communication advancements, the growth for the connected Forklift Trucks will gain traction over the forecast period. Rough terrain forklifts have the ability to tackle a wide range of site conditions - from pavement and hills to mud and back again.
