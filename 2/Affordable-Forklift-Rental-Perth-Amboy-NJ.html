<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain. A forklift that is overloaded while lifting a load at height can very easily tip over forwards, with potential of causing serious damage to property, equipment, and people. But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you out—and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>
