<p>Do you want to add some ride height to your vehicle? High load carrying capacity polyurethane wheels & rollers to protect floors.

<p>Jacks can also lessen fatigue of employees, as they won't be taking on the physical toll of moving heavy material. If you refuel the tanks twice a day (the average for full-time use), this equates to a yearly fuel cost of $1,500 for electric, $15,000 for diesel and about $12,500 for propane.

Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents. In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times.</p>

A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have. Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>

At the end of the day, lifting your truck can help you improve its look and performance, but you need to be confident in the work being done and the folks who are doing it. Even if that's not you, be honest.</p>

Included with the compressor will be a revolutionary "smart sensor" used to make sure your truck is always sitting at the proper ride height, regardless of what you are loading or towing.</p>
