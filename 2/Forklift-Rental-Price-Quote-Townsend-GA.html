The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
<p>A reliable alternative to the Stainless Lifter is the BT Lifter Galvanized LHM230G model with stainless steel axles and galvanized chassis and pump. Some SP Series models feature a 36-volt battery, which enables common batteries and chargers to be used across your lift truck fleet.

This means that Linde reach trucks can maneuver safely and quickly, even in confined spaces and handling conditions in warehouses.</p>

A forklift is any mechanical device, powered by an electric motor or internal combustion engine that is used to move or lift loads.
