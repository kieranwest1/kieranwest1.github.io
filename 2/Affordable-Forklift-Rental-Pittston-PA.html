From the wide-open operator window to its rock solid stability system, Crown's SP Series forklifts are designed to help busy order pickers maintain confidence at height and efficiently handle a variety of tasks. As the name suggests, the reach forklift is primarily designed to pick up loads high in racking or storage.</p>

A parking brake (or mechanism) shall be provided and capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 15 percent grade, whichever is the lesser.
