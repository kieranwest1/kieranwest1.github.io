<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Used for handling large amount of materials, this product is designed with a high level of precision at par with international quality parameters. Whatever materials handling task you need fulfilling, Cat Lift Trucks offer you one of the most dependable and complete counterbalance forklifts in the industry. The most notable feature of the rough terrain forklift is the oversized, aggressive treaded tires.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
