We are known as a 'One Stop Shop' for material handling equipment. The mast shall be at full rearward tilt and the forks the elevated until the point of intersection of the two load-carrying surfaces of the forks is 12 inches from the floor.</p>

Give us a call at 800-836-3882 if you have any questions or are interested in learning additional information about these trucks.
