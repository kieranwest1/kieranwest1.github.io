Unlike most car repairs or upgrades, lifting a truck requires a little more effort than getting a few gearhead friends together on a Sunday afternoon to gather around a toolbox and a twelve-pack.</p>
<h2>Hand Pallet Huntsville</h2>
<p>A vertical line extending from the center of gravity of the vehicle-load combination must stay inside the stability triangle to prevent the forklift from tipping.

In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
