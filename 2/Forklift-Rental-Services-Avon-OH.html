<p>In a stand-up forklift, most often they require the use of a joystick which can present a learning curve to some operators.

These permit the truck to drive over bumpy terrain without harming the vehicle's under-body. This abrasion can reduce the thickness of a fork until it cannot lift loads up to the designed capacity.

<p>Whether a complete beginner or an experienced operator, our range of forklift training benefits individuals or employees wanting to develop their skills. Like how its name says, the side loader forklift can drive up alongside pallet racks or other industrial shelving and can unload without having to turn.

<p>This removes the need for the operator to manually adjust the tines for different sized loads. Electric forklifts are quiet as well, making them ideal for warehouse and other indoor use.
