<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components.

Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
