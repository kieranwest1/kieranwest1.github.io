<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed.

Ensure that loads on pallets are stable, neat, cross-tied if possible, and evenly distributed. A reach truck looks like a very small type of counterbalance forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident.</p>

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>

<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up. In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
