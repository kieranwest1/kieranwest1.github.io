It may well be that you already know exactly what you want, in which case we will provide you with a quote.</p>
<p>Featuring a hydraulic jack that is manually operated from the handle, the manual pallet jack gets it name from the manual pump input to raise the fork.

That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
