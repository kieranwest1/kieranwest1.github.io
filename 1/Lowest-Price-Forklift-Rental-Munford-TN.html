<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>Compared to the internal combustion systems, the performance of AC trucks in parameters such as load-lift ability, ability to negotiate a ramp, acceleration, speed control on-ramps, and braking are gaining attraction of the industries.

We have a team of sales executives that are responsible for offering product information on our wide range of new Heli forklifts.

Industrial trucks can lift and lower thousands of pounds of goods on the lifting mechanism attached to them.

As someone with no forklift experience, you will do between three and six days of training before you take the test.

Moreover, the Motorised pallet truck we offer is quality approved and sturdy. They excel at having the best matched rental equipment for your application.
