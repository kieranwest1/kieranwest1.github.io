<h2>Fork Truck Manufacturers Bristol</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>Toyota's industrial vehicle and equipment business started in March 1956 with lift truck production and sales in Japan. In the process of training I was trained to work the controls and the capacity of the weight of the mass. Whether you need a short-term forklift rental when equipment is down for repair or you need to expand your forklift fleet for the busy season, Select Equipment's friendly staff is here to help.</p>
