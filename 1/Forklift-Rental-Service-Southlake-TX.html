<p>JCB rough terrain fork lifts (RTFLs) are a reliable, versatile and easy-to-use solution. People are clamoring for a lifted truck, so you won't have much trouble trying to sell one.

Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
