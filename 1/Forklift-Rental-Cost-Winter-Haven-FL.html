<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>
<p>Our friendly staff will work with you closely to better understand your operations and requirements, and help you choose the right forklift. Forklifts were first invented during early part of the 20th century and now had become a vital part of the modern-day industrial world.

<p>Some dealers will sell lifted trucks, but you may be more likely to find them through alternative means, like custom shops. If you've never rented before, you might be surprised at the actual forklift rental cost and how affordable it can be. However, statistics show that companies that own their fleets tend to keep their forklifts longer than financially makes sense.</p>

<p>Order pickers do exactly what their name implies - they pick” orders in a warehouse for stores, other distribution centers, retail centers, and more. Once you've decided on the forklift fuel type and lifting capacity, begin your search for unused and used forklifts in our current inventory. You can also hire our trucks for a longer fixed-term rental period, for up to 7 years.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
