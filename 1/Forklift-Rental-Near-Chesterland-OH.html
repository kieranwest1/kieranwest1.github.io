<p>The operation of this switch is designed so that movement of the forklift is not possible while the operator is stocking or picking product. While these two lift kits are somewhat similar, there are important differences between them. This will provide them with the necessary certifications to be able to use forklifts legally in their job. Even if you specified you would need the rental for a specific amount of time, i.e. 2 days, it is the renters responsibility to make sure the equipment is returned.</p>
<p>Counterbalance forklifts are probably the most common forklift trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores in the Vancouver area.

Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure. Many manufacturers opt for watertight wheel bearings, a hydraulic elevator or a built-in pump to ensure their rough terrain pallet jacks are easy and comfortable to use, even in the harshest conditions.</p>
<p>The dealer insures the equipment, but you or your company must cover the operator, other workers and the facility itself in case of an injury or property damage when using the rented forklift. Our forklifts are ready for immediate pickup or delivery. While lift kits can certainly increase utility, function and style for many truck owners, there are a few safety issues to consider first.</p>
