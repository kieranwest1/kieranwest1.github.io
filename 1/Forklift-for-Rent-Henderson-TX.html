<h3>How To Choose The Right Pallet Jack For The Job Henderson TX 75652</h3>
<p>For trucks with tilting forks, the forks should be horizontal of at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. The boom can reach out directly in front of the forklift, and it can be extended to raise directly above it.
