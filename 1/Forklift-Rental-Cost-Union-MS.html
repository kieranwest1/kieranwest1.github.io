<p>A lifted truck, often referred to as a 4x4 truck, is a modified vehicle specially designed for off road driving and other types of high-impact work. At a minimum, you should have a card or certificate of proof of training and the vehicle load charts (and attachment load charts as well, if applicable) on the jobsite—OSHA will look for these items first. In an effort to stand out but also fluently head off road and through disastrous weather conditions, we at Lewisville Autoplex Preowned suggest you try a custom lifted truck or Jeep vehicle.</p>

<p>Types of jobs where you might encounter rough terrain forklifts are lumber yards, builders, brick yards, land movers, construction workers, etc. Product-line features: Each of the four current Xtreme straight-mast forklifts offers choices in their mast, carriage and fork configurations, as well as such options and accessories as fourth function valves, a load cushion hydraulic system, a work-light package, a rotating beacon and mirrors.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
