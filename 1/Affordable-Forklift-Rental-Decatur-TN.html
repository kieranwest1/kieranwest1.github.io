It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>

Long-term maintenance and upkeep on these lifted trucks can be higher than standard models, so keep that in mind when considering your options.
