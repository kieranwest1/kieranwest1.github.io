<p>The most complex type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit, which allows your truck to be boosted higher than that of a body kit. Yale has been manufacturing materials handling equipment for over 140 years. Since 1949, Kalmar has been the preferred brand among quality-aware, heavy lift truck drivers and owners. Most rough terrain forklifts have safety glass paneling around the cab, too.</p>
