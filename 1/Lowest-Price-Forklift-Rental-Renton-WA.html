<p>Stringent emission norms are driving the demand for electric forklifts. Most forklifts have a three-point suspension system. There are also leveling kits that can be applied to a pickup, which raises just the front end of the truck so that it is level with the rear. The Raymond High-capacity Reach-Fork truck integrates telematics capabilities to increase efficiency.</p>
